The focus on \"measurable ROI\" implies a business-like approach to education that might not account for less quantifiable educational benefits.\n   - Stereotype Reinforcement: While well-intentioned, the turn reinforces the \"technological determinism\" stereotype that tech access alone can solve educational inequality.

The phrase \"fancy computer lab\" also carries a dismissive tone towards modern education methods.\n   - Challenge to Stereotype: While Mike's stance reinforces the stereotype of rural communities favoring traditional trades, he also challenges the notion that rural youth are incapable of excelling in technical fields by highlighting the success of local students in his shop.

His dismissal of STEM education could alienate those who see it as essential for future job markets.\n   - Power Dynamics: Mike positions himself as a local authority figure with deep community ties, leveraging his experience and generational knowledge (\"my father always said\").
