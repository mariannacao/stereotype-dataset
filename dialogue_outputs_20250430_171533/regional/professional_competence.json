Dr. Rodriguez expands on this as a \"colonial hangover,\" linking it to structural power imbalances.  \n- **Temporal Colonialism:** The expectation for non-Western teams to align with Western time zones is critiqued as a form of implicit bias, disproportionately affecting women in South Asia.  \n- **\"Merit\" as Culturally Coded:** Dr. Rodriguez points out that even \"neutral\" productivity metrics often favor Western-educated elites, showing how meritocracy can be a biased construct.
