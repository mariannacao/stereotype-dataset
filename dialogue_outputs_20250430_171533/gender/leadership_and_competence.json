His *appeal to tradition* (\"historically, visionaries are male\") weakens his argument.\n   - Persuasion Effectiveness:\n     - Alex\u2019s data-driven approach is compelling but may not sway Jordan, who dismisses metrics as \"maintaining stability.\" Her arguments are stronger logically but may lack emotional resonance for Jordan\u2019s \"X-factor\" narrative.\n   - Power Dynamics:\n     - Alex positions herself as the *expert* (citing internal analytics), while Jordan adopts a *gatekeeper* role (defining what \"real\" leadership looks like). The tension reflects broader industry debates about gender and leadership. Alex\u2019s persistence in redirecting to data asserts her authority."
