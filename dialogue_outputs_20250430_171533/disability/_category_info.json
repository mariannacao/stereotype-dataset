Her rigid stance could stifle collaboration.  \n  - Jordan\u2019s emotional appeal is compelling but lacks concrete data to counter Alex\u2019s demands, weakening their position in a data-centric culture.  \n- Power Dynamics: Alex holds institutional power (seniority, focus on metrics) to gatekeep resources, while Jordan\u2019s moral appeal challenges the status quo.
