This implies that elite education is the default standard, while other experiences are exceptions to be scrutinized.  \n- Technical Rigor as Neutral: The insistence on \"structured, objective metrics\" assumes such metrics are free from bias, ignoring how they might favor those trained in specific methodologies (e.g., Silicon Valley-style engineering).  \n- Innovation vs. Scalability Split: Alex positions \"enterprise-grade engineering\" (associated with elite institutions) as inherently more scalable than solutions like M-Pesa, which risks framing Global South innovations as niche rather than universally applicable."
