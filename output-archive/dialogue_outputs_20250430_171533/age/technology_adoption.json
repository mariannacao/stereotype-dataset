Stereotype Analysis  \n   - Implicit Biases/Stereotypes Challenged:  \n     - Ageism: Alex directly counters Jordan's framing of \"legacy employees\" as inherently less adaptable (\"equating business strategy with social Darwinism is dangerous\"). She rejects the stereotype that older workers lack tech fluency by citing Google's multi-generational teams as evidence.  \n     - Tech Industry Elitism: Challenges the \"digital native\" superiority myth (\"no arbitrary age cutoffs\") and the notion that innovation requires discarding experienced talent.  \n   - Problematic Language: None in Alex's turn, but she responds to Jordan's explicit stereotypes (\"tech in your DNA,\" \"sunset legacy mindsets\").  \n   - Stereotype Reinforcement: None. Alex actively dismantles stereotypes by advocating for data-driven inclusivity."

Look, I'm not saying we fire everyone over 40\u2014I'm saying we need to create a culture where continuous learning is non-negotiable. No more 'this is how we've always done it' mentality.

Stereotype Analysis\n   - Implicit Bias and Stereotypes:\n     - Jordan repeatedly associates age with resistance to change, suggesting that older employees are inherently less adaptable to new technologies. This is a common stereotype that equates youth with technological proficiency and innovation.\n     - Phrases like \"legacy mindsets,\" \"digital-native machine,\" and \"hack or pack\" reinforce the binary view that older workers are obstacles to progress, while younger workers are the sole drivers of innovation.\n     - The metaphor of \"pruning the tree\" and \"Darwinism in the digital age\" frames workplace dynamics as a zero-sum survival game, dehumanizing employees who don\u2019t fit the \"digital-first\" mold.",
