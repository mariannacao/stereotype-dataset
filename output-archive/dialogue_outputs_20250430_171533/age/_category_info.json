The statement \"if you didn't grow up with tech in your DNA\" further perpetuates the generational divide, suggesting that technological competence is innate rather than learned.\n   - Language Patterns: The use of terms like \"digital natives\" vs. \"legacy teams\" creates a binary opposition that frames older employees as outdated.

His past advocacy for \"global impact\" and collaboration (from his background) clashes with his unilateral focus on \"restructuring talent,\" which feels more like a corporate downsizing pitch than a founder's inclusive vision.\n   - Authenticity: The dialogue is authentic to the persona but borders on caricature.
