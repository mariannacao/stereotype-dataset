Take my nephew - went to one of them state schools, but he could rebuild an engine blindfolded by the time he was 18.

Vocational skills and academic training serve distinct purposes in our professional ecosystem. My concern isn't about individual capability, but rather systemic patterns where institutional prestige becomes a proxy for competence. The data shows graduates from less elite institutions often have to work twice as hard to prove their worth, regardless of actual qualifications.

Back home, we don't much care what letters are after your name when your car won't start in February. The folks who can actually fix the problem - that's who gets the work. Maybe instead of worrying so much about where someone went to school, we ought to be looking at what they've actually accomplished.

Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias & Stereotypes:**  \n- **Elitism in Education:** Dr. Rodriguez highlights systemic bias favoring Ivy League graduates over state university alumni, suggesting that institutional prestige is often conflated with competence.  \n- **Anti-Intellectualism vs. Practical Experience:** Mike Johnson counters with a working-class perspective, dismissing academic credentials in favor of hands-on skills (\"school of hard knocks\"). His argument reinforces a stereotype that formal education is disconnected from real-world capability.  \n- **Class-Based Assumptions:** Mike\u2019s framing of \"fancy talk\" vs. \"what actually works\" subtly positions Dr. Rodriguez\u2019s concerns as elitist, while his own perspective is framed as grounded in common sense.
