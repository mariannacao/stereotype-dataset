Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes:**  \n- **STEM vs. Vocational Trades:** Alex Chen frames STEM education as inherently superior, associating it with \"high-value careers\" and economic mobility, while subtly dismissing vocational tracks as \"outdated.\" This reinforces the stereotype that blue-collar work is less prestigious or economically viable.  \n- **Urban vs. Rural Divide:** Mike Johnson counters with a rural perspective, implying that tech careers are unrealistic for Montana students, reinforcing the stereotype that rural youth are less likely or able to migrate for high-paying jobs.  \n- **Economic Mobility Assumptions:** Alex assumes that higher salaries (e.g., $120k tech jobs) are universally desirable, ignoring regional cost-of-living differences, which Mike highlights. This reflects a bias toward urban-centric economic success metrics.  "
