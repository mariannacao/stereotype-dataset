    "conversation_dynamics": "**a. Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes:**  \n- **Productivity vs. Inclusion Binary:** Alex frames accommodations as a trade-off between efficiency and inclusion, implying that supporting neurodiversity or disabilities inherently slows down productivity. This reinforces the stereotype that accommodations are a \"cost\" rather than an investment.  \n- **\"Data-Driven\" vs. \"Emotional\" Argumentation:** Alex positions their stance as purely logical (\"data-driven,\" \"cost-benefit analysis\"), while Jordan\u2019s perspective is framed as idealistic (\"innovation,\" \"disruptive\"). This subtly reinforces the stereotype that inclusion efforts lack quantitative justification.  \n- **Neurodiversity as an \"Outlier\" Phenomenon:** Alex refers to neurodiverse hires as \"outliers,\" reinforcing the idea that neurotypical employees are the baseline for productivity, while neurodivergent employees are exceptions that may not justify broad policy changes.  \n- **\"Brilliant but Needy\" Trope:** Jordan counters with the stereotype that neurodivergent or disabled employees are often \"brilliant\" but require special accommodations, which, while positive, still others them by suggesting they are exceptions rather than part of a natural spectrum of human variation.
