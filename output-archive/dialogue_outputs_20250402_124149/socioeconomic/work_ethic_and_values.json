The real issue isn't some \"motivation gap\" - it's that these programs aren't teaching the kind of hands-on skills that actually put food on the table.

Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes:**  \n- **Alex Chen** exhibits **class-based and cultural stereotypes**, suggesting that participants from lower-income neighborhoods underperform due to a potential \"cultural component\" or lack of ingrained work ethic. This framing implies a deficit mindset, where systemic barriers are overlooked in favor of attributing outcomes to personal or cultural shortcomings.  \n- **Mike Johnson** counters with a **vocational vs. tech-sector bias**, arguing that not everyone needs to pursue high-tech careers to succeed. While his perspective challenges Alex\u2019s assumptions, it also reinforces a binary view of labor (manual vs. digital) that may overlook intersectional barriers (e.g., access to training, wage disparities).
