We need to democratize access to these skills - they're the new literacy. What metrics are we using to evaluate the ROI on our current tech education programs?\"",

We're pouring money into computers when half these kids can't even read a tape measure.

While vocational skills are important, we can't ignore the economic reality that automation is transforming every industry, including yours. The question isn't whether we can afford to invest in STEM, but whether we can afford not to. My parents were factory workers who pushed me into coding - now I'm helping build the AI systems that are automating those same factories. We owe these kids that same chance to adapt.\"",

Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias & Stereotypes:**  \n- **Class & Access to Opportunity:** Mike Johnson frames STEM education as a \"luxury\" for \"city kids\" with \"fancy internships,\" reinforcing the stereotype that low-income or rural students cannot or should not pursue tech careers. He implies that coding is irrelevant to their immediate needs, while Alex argues that STEM skills are essential for economic mobility.  \n- **Vocational vs. Tech Education:** Mike associates blue-collar work with \"real skills\" (e.g., auto repair, manual labor) while dismissing coding as \"fancy tech stuff,\" suggesting a false dichotomy between vocational training and tech literacy.  \n- **Urban vs. Rural Divide:** Mike assumes that rural students are inherently disconnected from tech opportunities, while Alex counters that automation will impact all industries, including Mike\u2019s.
