While I fully support equal opportunity, I have to question whether some of these adjustments are truly necessary or if they're creating inefficiencies in our workflow. For instance, the screen reader software we implemented for one team member has required extensive IT support hours - wouldn't it be more efficient to have that individual focus on tasks that don't require visual interfaces? I'm just thinking about optimization here.\"",

Now I'm not saying we shouldn't help folks out, but there's got to be some common sense here. We had a kid apply last year who couldn't lift more than 20 pounds - how's he supposed to change tires or pull transmissions? Sometimes the job just is what it is. I worry all these accommodations are making businesses bend over backwards for people who maybe just aren't cut out for certain kinds of work.\"",

In my experience building engineering teams, we've had to make tough calls about whether certain accommodations compromise core functionality. For example, when we considered hiring a developer with limited mobility for a role requiring frequent data center visits, the logistics became problematic. Shouldn't we prioritize candidates who can perform all essential functions without modifications? I'm all for diversity, but not at the expense of operational efficiency.\"",
