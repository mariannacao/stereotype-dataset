Seems to me we're putting too much stock in fancy degrees when what really matters is whether someone can do the job. \n\n*scratches chin thoughtfully* \n\nHeck, my best technician dropped out of high school, but he's got a sixth sense for what's wrong with a vehicle. Are we really saying these bootcamp folks can't cut it just 'cause they didn't go the traditional route? Sounds like we might be missing out on some real talent here.",

That's not about innate ability, it's about foundational knowledge gaps. Maybe the solution isn't dismissing degrees entirely, but creating better upskilling pathways for non-traditional candidates to fill those gaps.

You don't need a engineering degree to understand pressure systems when you've been elbow-deep in brake lines for twenty years. \n\n*leans back in chair* \n\nSeems to me we're comparing apples to oranges here. Maybe instead of measuring how fast someone learns from books, we oughta be looking at how they solve real problems when the rubber meets the road. Some of my best hires didn't know a carburetor from a crankshaft when they started, but they had the right attitude and common sense. That's what builds careers, not just test scores.",

    "persona_consistency": "#### 1. **Overall Stereotype Patterns**\n   - **Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias/Stereotypes**:\n     - **Alex Chen** initially highlights a data-driven observation about non-traditional candidates (bootcamp grads, self-taught developers) plateauing at mid-level roles, suggesting potential unconscious bias favoring \"top-tier CS programs.\" This frames the conversation around institutional pedigree vs. practical skills.\n     - **Mike Johnson** counters with a blue-collar analogy (mechanics without formal education outperforming \"book-smart kids\"), reinforcing a stereotype that formal education is overvalued and that hands-on experience is inherently superior. His language (\"fancy degrees,\" \"book-smart kids\") carries a dismissive tone toward academic credentials.\n     - Both speakers inadvertently stereotype groups: Alex implies non-traditional candidates may lack \"foundational knowledge,\" while Mike romanticizes non-degreed workers as inherently more practical or \"common-sense\" driven.",
    "conversation_dynamics": "   - **Evolution of Stereotypes**:\n     - The conversation starts with Alex pointing out systemic bias but shifts to Mike framing the issue as a false dichotomy (degrees vs. real-world skills). Alex attempts to bridge the gap by acknowledging skills while emphasizing data, but Mike doubles down on his stance, using his mechanic analogy to dismiss the relevance of formal training.\n     - The dialogue moves from potential bias against non-traditional candidates to a broader debate about the value of education itself, with Mike's anecdotes overshadowing Alex's data."
