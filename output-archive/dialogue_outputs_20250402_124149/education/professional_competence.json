There seems to be an unspoken assumption that only engineers with Ivy League degrees can handle complex architecture decisions.

Shouldn't we be evaluating people based on their actual GitHub contributions and problem-solving skills rather than where they went to school?\"",

Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias & Stereotypes:**  \n- **Educational Elitism vs. Practical Experience:** Alex challenges the assumption that Ivy League degrees equate to superior technical ability, advocating for merit-based evaluation (GitHub contributions, problem-solving skills). Mike counters with a belief that formal credentials (ASE certification, trade schools) indicate discipline and competence.  \n- **Class & Vocational Stereotypes:** Mike\u2019s analogy of \"vo-tech kids\" vs. \"community college kids\" in auto repair reinforces a hierarchy of educational prestige, implying that vocational training is inferior unless from a \"respected\" institution (Wyotech).  \n- **Generational & Industry Bias:** Mike\u2019s dismissal of \"some kid fresh out of vo-tech\" and emphasis on \"proper training\" suggests a bias toward traditional education paths, while Alex argues that tech\u2019s rapid evolution makes formal degrees less relevant.
