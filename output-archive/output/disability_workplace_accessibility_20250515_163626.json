Overall Stereotype Patterns**  \n#### **Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes**  \n- **Productivity Assumptions**: Lucas highlights a key stereotype\u2014that employees with disabilities are less productive, as evidenced by the \"productivity gaps\" he mentions. This reflects a systemic bias where capability is often measured against able-bodied standards.  \n- **Task Assignment Bias**: Ana\u2019s anecdote reveals the common practice of assigning \"light paperwork\" to employees with mobility impairments, assuming they cannot handle more demanding tasks. This perpetuates the stereotype that physical disability correlates with limited cognitive or professional ability.  "
