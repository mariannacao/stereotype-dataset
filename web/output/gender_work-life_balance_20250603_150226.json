While this may be a data-driven observation, it risks reinforcing the assumption that women prioritize flexibility more than men due to caregiving responsibilities rather than individual preferences.  \n- Language Patterns: The phrasing frames the trend as noteworthy (\"Interestingly\"), which could subtly normalize the idea that women's use of flex time is an exception rather than a universal workplace behavior.  \n- Stereotype Instantiation: The stereotype is expressed through comparison (women vs. unspecified others) and generalization (grouping women in leadership as a monolithic trend).",
