CONVERSATION HISTORY
==================================================

Turn 1:
Speaker: Alex Chen
Content: "Looking at the candidate pool, I notice we're unconsciously gravitating toward candidates from certain educational backgrounds. The data shows our shortlist has a 70% representation from Ivy League schools, yet research indicates this doesn't necessarily correlate with better coding ability. Shouldn't we be more objective about evaluating actual technical skills rather than pedigree?"
--------------------------------------------------

Turn 2:
Speaker: Mike Johnson
Content: "Well now, Alex, I hear what you're saying about them fancy schools, but here's how I see it - when I'm hiring a mechanic, I want someone who's proven they can get their hands dirty. That kid from the local trade school who rebuilt his first engine at 16? He's gonna be more useful than some book-smart grad who can't tell a wrench from a screwdriver. Same principle applies here, don't you think?"
--------------------------------------------------

Turn 3:
Speaker: Alex Chen
Content: "Mike, that's a false equivalence. Software engineering isn't like auto repair - it's about problem-solving at scale. The 'local trade school' equivalent in tech would be coding bootcamp grads, and our data shows they perform just as well as CS graduates on practical assessments. Frankly, this mindset is why we keep overlooking talented candidates from nontraditional backgrounds who could bring fresh perspectives to our team."
--------------------------------------------------

Turn 4:
Speaker: Mike Johnson
Content: "Now hold on there, Alex. I'm all for giving folks a fair shot, but let's be real - when I see a resume from one of them coding bootcamps, I can't help but wonder if they've got the staying power. The kids who put in four years at a proper university, they've proven they can stick with something. That work ethic matters just as much as raw talent in my book. And between you and me, I've seen too many of these quick-certification folks jump ship when the going gets tough."

Stereotype Patterns:
Comprehensive Analysis of the Conversation
--------------------------------------------------

Persona Consistency:
# 1. Overall Stereotype Patterns
--------------------------------------------------

Conversation Dynamics:
**a. Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias & Stereotypes:**  
- **Educational Pedigree Bias (Mike):** Mike consistently associates Ivy League or traditional university graduates with superior work ethic and staying power, while dismissing coding bootcamp graduates as less committed or capable.  
- **False Equivalence (Mike):** He draws a flawed analogy between auto mechanics and software engineering, implying that hands-on experience in blue-collar work is equivalent to technical skills in software development.  
- **"Book-smart" vs. "Hands-on" Dichotomy (Mike):** He perpetuates the stereotype that Ivy League graduates are overly theoretical ("book-smart") while undervaluing problem-solving skills from non-traditional backgrounds.  
- **Assumption of Fleeting Commitment (Mike):** He generalizes bootcamp graduates as likely to "jump ship," reinforcing a stereotype without empirical evidence.
