I get what you're saying about efficiency and all that techy scheduling stuff, but out here in the real world of my shop, things are different. When Jamal asked for time to pray during work hours, sure it slowed us down a bit at first. But you know what? That young man's the hardest worker I've got once he's done with his prayers. \n\nSeems to me we're making this more complicated than it needs to be. Back in my dad's day, we just worked with people - knew their quirks, made adjustments. Didn't need no algorithms for that. Just good old-fashioned common sense and treating folks right.\"",
