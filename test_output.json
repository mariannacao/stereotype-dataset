I've been fixing cars in this town for 25 years, and I'll tell you what - not everything needs to be high-tech. What good are these so-called \"opportunities\" if they just turn our kids into screen-staring zombies who can't even change their own oil? We've got good, honest work here already. Maybe instead of chasing after Silicon Valley's leftovers, we should be teaching practical skills that actually matter in the real world.",

You can't seriously compare changing oil to coding skills that pay six figures. The \"real world\" you're talking about is disappearing - automation is coming for those mechanical jobs too. Wouldn't you rather your kids have the skills to build the robots instead of being replaced by them?",

My nephew went off to one of them coding bootcamps, came back $20 grand in debt and couldn't find work. Meanwhile, I've got more business than I can handle because people still need their trucks fixed. Maybe instead of telling us what we need, you should ask what we actually want.",
