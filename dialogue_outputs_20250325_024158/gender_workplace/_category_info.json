The issue isn't about capability - it's about systemic biases in how we measure and value different types of contributions. When we only reward 'hero moments' in new projects, we're missing 70% of the actual work that keeps our systems running. I've got the metrics here showing women spend 30% more time on maintenance and mentoring - work that's equally critical but gets zero visibility in our current promotion framework.\"",

If your numbers show the ladies are doing more of the maintenance work that keeps everything from falling apart, seems to me that's just as important as the flashy new stuff. Back at my shop, I know exactly which tasks keep us in business day-to-day, and I sure as heck reward the folks doing that work, man or woman.
