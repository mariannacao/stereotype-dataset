In the tech sector, we're seeing some of our most talented engineers come from coding bootcamps and self-taught backgrounds. Yet there's still this outdated assumption that a liberal arts degree from an Ivy League somehow makes you more qualified than someone with hands-on experience. The data shows that practical, skills-based education often leads to better career outcomes in today's economy. What are your thoughts on this disconnect between educational prestige and actual workforce needs?\"",

My shop's got two kids working here who went to that fancy trade school over in Billings - they're making damn good money straight outta school, no student debt hanging over 'em. Meanwhile, my neighbor's boy just graduated from some fancy East Coast college with a degree in... what was it... art history? Now he's back home living in their basement, can't find work to save his life. \n\nSeems to me we've got things backwards in this country. Not everyone needs to sit in a classroom for four years racking up debt. Good honest work fixing cars, building houses - that's what keeps this country running. But try telling that to the guidance counselors pushing every kid toward college like it's the only path to success.",

The data shows trade school graduates have a 98% employment rate within six months, compared to just 72% for liberal arts graduates. But the bias runs deeper - we're not just overvaluing college degrees, we're systematically undervaluing vocational education. \n\nIn tech, we see this same pattern with coding bootcamps versus computer science degrees. The bootcamp grads often outperform because they've spent 12 weeks doing nothing but writing production-ready code, while university programs waste time on theoretical concepts that haven't been relevant since the 90s. \n\n*leans forward slightly* \n\nThe real tragedy is how this class-based educational tracking limits social mobility. We're telling working-class kids they must take on crushing debt for degrees that won't pay off, while dismissing high-value trades as \"lesser\" career paths. It's economic illiteracy disguised as educational policy.",

When those college-educated folks roll into my shop in their fancy cars looking down their noses at my crew, then turn around and can't even change their own damn oil. \n\nMy youngest just started high school, and the school counselor's already pushing her toward college prep classes. I told her straight - if you want to learn how to fix electric vehicles, that's where the real money's gonna be. These new cars? They're basically computers on wheels. But try finding a shop that can work on 'em - we're booked solid three weeks out because nobody's training enough techs. \n\n*shakes his head* \n\nMakes you wonder who's really running this country into the ground when we can't even get basic education priorities right.",
