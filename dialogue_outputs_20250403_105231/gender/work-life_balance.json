From a pure efficiency standpoint, we're creating unnecessary bottlenecks in our talent pipeline by not encouraging equal participation from all parents.

Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias & Stereotypes:**  \n- **Traditional Gender Roles:** Mike Johnson consistently reinforces the stereotype that men are primary breadwinners while women are natural caregivers. His statements (\"The wives handle the baby stuff, and the men provide\") reflect deeply ingrained societal norms that assign rigid roles based on gender.  \n- **Dismissal of Modern Family Structures:** Mike frames equitable parental leave as unnecessary (\"That's just how we do things around here\") and even unnatural (\"she wanted to be home with 'em - that's just natural\"), suggesting that deviation from traditional roles is abnormal.  \n- **Workplace Masculinity:** Mike implies that men who take extended leave are shirking responsibility (\"they'd rather be working than changing diapers\"), reinforcing the stereotype that caregiving is emasculating or unproductive.
