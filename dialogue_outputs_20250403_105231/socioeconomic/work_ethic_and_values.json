Some folks are just better with their hands, and there's nothing wrong with that. My shop keeps three good men employed, and we're busier than ever. \n\n*shakes head* \n\nThis idea that everyone needs to be some kind of tech whiz - that's city thinking. Out here, people still need their trucks fixed, their furnaces working, their roofs patched. You can't code your way out of a broken axle. Maybe instead of pushing everyone toward keyboards, we should be valuing the kind of hard work that actually keeps this community running.",

The median salary for auto mechanics is what - $45,000? A junior developer fresh out of bootcamp makes nearly double that. Shouldn't we be giving people pathways to higher earning potential instead of resigning them to stagnant wages? \n\n*leans in, tapping tablet screen* \n\nLook at these workforce projections - blue-collar jobs are being automated at alarming rates. The hands-on work you value? It's exactly the kind of labor that AI and robotics are poised to disrupt. I'm not saying ditch all vocational training, but we'd be negligent not to prioritize digital literacy. The future belongs to those who can work with technology, not against it.",

Some of us take pride in real work - the kind where you can see what you've accomplished at the end of the day. \n\n*gestures toward window* \n\nYou think old man Jenkins cares about \"digital literacy\" when his tractor won't start during harvest? Or when the Thompson kid's car won't run for his first job interview? These \"stagnant wages\" you're so worried about put food on tables and keep roofs over heads in this town. \n\n*shakes head* \n\nSeems to me you're looking down on honest work while chasing some Silicon Valley pipe dream.

    "conversation_dynamics": "**a. Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes:**  \n- **Urban vs. Rural Divide:** Alex Chen frames digital skills as essential for economic mobility, implicitly suggesting that traditional vocational jobs are outdated or inferior. This reflects a common urban-centric bias that undervalues blue-collar labor.  \n- **Class and Education Bias:** Alex associates higher wages with tech jobs, implying that blue-collar workers are economically stagnant. This reinforces the stereotype that manual labor is less valuable or prestigious.  \n- **Generational and Technological Bias:** Mike Johnson dismisses digital literacy as \"city thinking,\" portraying tech jobs as unnatural or undesirable for \"real\" workers. This reflects a resistance to change and a romanticization of traditional labor.  "
