I get that change is hard, but in today's market, if you can't pivot fast and learn new systems, you're basically roadkill. We need to ask ourselves - are we being too accommodating to people who just don't have the digital native advantage? Maybe it's time to push harder on upskilling or make some tough calls about who's really future-proof for this organization.\"",

Look, I'm not saying they can't learn, but at our burn rate, we don't have time for remedial tech training.

The real inefficiency comes when we silo these strengths instead of integrating them.

This reinforces the **digital native vs. digital immigrant** stereotype, assuming age determines technological adaptability.  \n- **Productivity & Value Assumptions:** Jordan implies that older employees may not be \"future-proof,\" suggesting they are less valuable in a fast-changing market. This subtly devalues experience in favor of perceived agility.  \n- **Learning Style Generalizations:** Alex challenges the assumption that training struggles are purely generational, pointing out that learning styles may be misaligned rather than capability being age-dependent.
