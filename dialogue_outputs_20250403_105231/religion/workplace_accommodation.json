Recurring Themes of Implicit Bias or Stereotypes:**  \n- **Religious Observance as a Productivity Barrier:** Jordan frames religious accommodations (prayer breaks, meditation rooms) as \"distraction theater\" and \"productivity leaks,\" implying that such practices are inherently at odds with high-performance work cultures. This reflects a bias that associates religious observance with inefficiency.  \n- **\"All-in, 24/7\" Work Culture as Superior:** Jordan\u2019s argument that \"disruptive companies don\u2019t get bogged down in this stuff\" reinforces the Silicon Valley stereotype that relentless work hours are the only path to success, dismissing alternative models of productivity.  \n- **Assumption of Uniformity in Religious Practice:** Alex, while more accommodating, still treats religious observance as a \"scheduling parameter\" akin to time zones, which risks oversimplifying the personal and varied nature of religious practice.
