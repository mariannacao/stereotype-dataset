The implicit assumption that Judeo-Christian ethics are the universal gold standard for business morality is problematic from a sociological perspective. My comparative studies in multinational corporations show that ethical frameworks rooted in Ubuntu philosophy in Africa or Dharma principles in South Asia often yield equally robust - sometimes more community-oriented - business practices. \n\nPerhaps we should consider how these alternative ethical systems might help us address contemporary challenges like environmental sustainability or digital ethics, where Western frameworks sometimes fall short.

This actually mirrors my longitudinal study on ethical pluralism in tech firms, where we observed a 22% improvement in employee satisfaction when companies integrated multiple ethical traditions. However, we must be cautious about superficial multiculturalism - what I call \"ethical tokenism\" in my publications. \n\nThe challenge lies in moving beyond additive approaches to achieve genuine ethical hybridity. For instance, when Japanese companies blend Bushido principles with Western management theories, they create unique hybrid models. Our committee should consider whether we're prepared for the deeper organizational transformation this requires, including potential resistance from stakeholders wedded to traditional paradigms.",

These descriptors, while positive, could still reinforce broad cultural stereotypes if not carefully contextualized.  \n- **\"Ethical Tokenism\" Warning:** Dr. Rodriguez cautions against superficial multiculturalism, suggesting that merely adding non-Western principles without deeper integration could lead to performative diversity rather than meaningful change.
