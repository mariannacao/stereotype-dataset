This suggests we might have an implicit bias where caregiving responsibilities are automatically assigned to women. As a company that prides itself on data-driven policies, shouldn't we examine why men aren't taking equal advantage of these benefits? The productivity impact studies actually show that when both parents share leave equally, it leads to better long-term retention for all genders.\"",

When my wife had our kids, she stayed home because that's just what made sense - she wanted to be with the babies, and I needed to keep the business running to support our family. That's how most folks around here do it. I'm not against men helping out, but let's be honest - someone's gotta bring home the paycheck, and usually that's the man's job. These surveys might show one thing, but out here in the real world, traditional family roles just work better for most people.\"",
