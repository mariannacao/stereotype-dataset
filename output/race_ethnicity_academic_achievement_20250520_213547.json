While she clarifies that this is due to resources rather than intelligence, the phrasing still centers \"established areas\" as a normative benchmark.  \n  - The comparison between zip codes in insurance claims and student performance risks oversimplifying systemic inequities by attributing outcomes primarily to access (though she avoids blaming individuals).",

The turn reflects her \"traditional yet adaptable\" stance by acknowledging systemic issues without radical framing.  \n- Authenticity: Feels authentic for a suburban insurance agent with community awareness; avoids jargon, focusing on observable patterns.",
