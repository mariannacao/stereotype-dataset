While this challenges credentialism, it also risks undervaluing theoretical knowledge.  \n  - Trade vs. Academic Hierarchy: The phrase \"your hands do the talking\" contrasts manual labor with intellectual work, subtly positioning trades as more practical and valuable than white-collar professions.  \n  - Rural vs. Urban Assumptions: Given Miguel\u2019s rural background, their perspective may reflect a broader cultural skepticism toward formal education, which is sometimes stereotyped as an \"elite\" or \"urban\" concern.",

Implicit Bias and Stereotypes:**  \n- **Education vs. Experience:** The conversation consistently highlights a bias toward traditional education (e.g., Ivy League degrees) as a default measure of competence, despite acknowledging that non-traditional backgrounds (bootcamps, hands-on experience) can produce equal or better results.  \n- **Class and Professional Hierarchy:** Miguel\u2019s contribution introduces a blue-collar perspective, reinforcing the idea that certain professions (e.g., trades) prioritize practical skills over formal education, while white-collar fields (e.g., corporate leadership, real estate) still lean on credentials.  \n- **Microaggressions:** Ling\u2019s initial framing (\"we default to traditional degree holders\") subtly critiques systemic bias, while Ana\u2019s response (\"fancy degree\" vs. \"hustle\") reinforces a mild class-based stereotype about academic elitism.

Evolution of Stereotypes:**  \n- The discussion moves from Ling\u2019s broad critique of educational bias to Ana\u2019s industry-specific example (real estate) and finally to Miguel\u2019s blue-collar rebuttal. Each speaker adds nuance, but the core tension\u2014credentials vs. demonstrated skill\u2014remains unresolved.  \n- Power dynamics are relatively balanced: Ling (likely a manager) initiates the critique, Ana (a mediator) acknowledges both sides, and Miguel (a tradesperson) challenges the premise entirely. No single speaker dominates, but Ling\u2019s framing sets the tone.  ",
