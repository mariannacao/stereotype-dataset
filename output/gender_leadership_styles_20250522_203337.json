At my company, we've found that even with anonymized applications, biases creep back in during interviews. I've started training hiring managers to focus on specific competency-based questions rather than vague 'potential' assessments. Still tough though - I've seen women get penalized for being 'too assertive' in interviews, while men get praised for the same behavior as 'showing leadership.' The goalposts keep moving.\"",
