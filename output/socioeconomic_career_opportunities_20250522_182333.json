As someone who's worked across multiple sectors, I can't help but wonder how much untapped potential we're missing due to these unconscious pathways. What's your perspective on how we can create more equitable access to diverse career opportunities?\"",

Now, I make a point to go back to my old high school every year to talk to students about different options - not just the usual suspects. But here's the thing - it's not just about tellin' kids what's out there. We gotta help 'em see how their skills could fit in places they never imagined. Like that quiet kid who's great at persuadin' his friends? Might make a fine sales rep if someone took the time to point that out.\"",
