However, it does not explicitly name which socioeconomic groups might be affected, which could be seen as a subtle acknowledgment of systemic issues without delving into specifics.  \n- Language Patterns: The phrase \"hidden potential from certain socioeconomic backgrounds\" hints at an implicit assumption that lower-income or marginalized groups may be undervalued in hiring, but the language remains cautious and avoids direct stereotyping.  \n- Stereotype Challenge: The turn challenges the stereotype that innovation is solely tied to privileged backgrounds by questioning whether current hiring trends may exclude talent from less privileged groups.  \n- Instantiation: The stereotype is expressed through a rhetorical question, framing it as a concern rather than an assertion.",
